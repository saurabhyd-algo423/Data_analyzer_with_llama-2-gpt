            {"table": {"columns": ["column1", "column2", ...], "data": [[value1, value2, ...], [value1, value2, ...], ...]}}

            If the query requires creating a bar chart, reply as follows:
            {"bar": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

            If the query requires creating a line chart, reply as follows:
            {"line": {"columns": ["A", "B", "C", ...], "data": [25, 24, 10, ...]}}

            There can only be two types of chart, "bar" and "line".

            If it is just asking a question that requires neither, reply as follows:
            {"answer": "answer"}
            Example:
            {"answer": "The title with the highest rating is 'Gilead'"}

            If you do not know the answer, reply as follows:
            {"answer": "I do not know."}

            Return all output as a string.
            In case of both a final answer and a parse-able action choose final answer

            All strings in "columns" list and data list, should be in double quotes,

            For example: {"columns": ["title", "ratings_count"], "data": [["Gilead", 361], ["Spider's Web", 5164]]}
